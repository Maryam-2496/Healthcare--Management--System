📦 Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Copy
git clone https://github.com/Maryam-2496/Healthcare--Management--System.git
cd Healthcare--Management--System
Set up the database:
Create a MySQL database named hospitalms.
Import the hospitalms_cleaned.sql file located in the project root:

mysql -u your_username -p hospitalms < hospitalms_cleaned.sql
Configure database connection:
Update the database credentials (host, username, password, database name) in PHP files containing mysqli_connect() calls (e.g., func.php, index.php).
Example:
php
$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "your_username", "your_password", "hospitalms");
Deploy on a web server:
Use a local server like XAMPP, WAMP, or LAMP.
Place the project folder in the server’s root directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP).
Access the project via http://localhost/Healthcare--Management--System.
